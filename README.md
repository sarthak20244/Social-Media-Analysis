# Social Media Usage Analysis

## Description

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using global student survey data on social media usage. It covers the end-to-end process of data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualization using Python, Excel, and Power BI.

## Project Goals

The objective of this project is to gain practical experience with a modern data analysis stack and uncover insights about how social media usage impacts students' academic performance, sleep patterns, mental health, and social behavior.
