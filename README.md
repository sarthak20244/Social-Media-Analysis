## Data Ingestion, Cleaning, and Exploration

### Raw Data

- **countries of the world.csv**: Includes country, region, area, and population information for regional enrichment.
- **ss.csv**: Contains 705 survey responses covering:
  - Daily usage hours
  - Most used platforms
  - Perceived academic impact
  - Mental health score
  - Sleep hours
  - Conflicts due to social media

### Python Notebook Highlights

- Load and merge datasets with **pandas**
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies with **NumPy**
- Analyze usage patterns across demographic groups
- Correlate social media usage with academics, sleep, and mental health using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Export the cleaned dataset for visualization in Power BI

## Key Findings

| Metric | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **Gender** | Balanced dataset with approximately 50% male and 50% female respondents |
| **Average Daily Usage** | Approximately 5 hours per day, about 30% higher than healthy recommendations |
| **Most Addictive Platforms** | WhatsApp and Snapchat have the highest average addiction scores (~7.4/10) |
| **High Addiction Rate** | 28% of students have an addiction score above 7 |
| **Sleep Patterns** | Highly addicted students sleep about 1.6 hours less than others |
| **Mental Health** | High usage correlates with lower mental health scores (4.97 vs. 6.71) |
| **Social Conflicts** | Strong positive correlation (0.93) between high usage and conflicts |

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

- Filters for country, gender, and platform
- KPIs for social media addiction rate, academic impact, and sleep duration
- Visualizations highlighting how social media usage affects academic performance, sleep, mental health, and conflicts

### KPI Summary

| KPI | Value | Insight |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Average Daily Usage** | 4.9 hours | About 30% higher than recommended levels |
| **High Addiction Rate** | 28% | About 1 in 4 students are highly addicted |
| **Average Sleep (High Addiction)** | 5.7 hours | About 1.6 hours less than low-addiction students |
| **Mental Health (High Addiction)** | 4.97/10 | Approximately 25% lower than low-addiction students |
| **Academic Impact** | 68% | Reported a decline in academic performance |

## How to Use

1. Open `SocialMediaAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to replicate the full analysis.
2. Open `social_media.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
3. Connect to the provided CSV files if prompted for data sources in Power BI.

## Below are the key visualizations and insights created in Power BI.

## 1. Social Media Addiction by Age
- Question: Which age groups are most affected by social media addiction?
  ![Capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5ef37a-2ac1-4bb1-89cf-c6e0d3ed37cf)

- Insight:
  
           1.Age 20 (23.89%) and 24 (23.56%) top the chart, making up nearly half (47.45%) of all cases.
 
           2.Age 21 follows closely with 22.65%, indicating that early 20s are the most vulnerable group.

## 2. Mental Health Score vs Risk
- Question: How does mental health score correlate with addiction, academic, and sleep risks?
  ![Capture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e259c75-739e-41b8-9640-abf6a7a6bb0f)

- Insight:

           1.Risk levels peak at a mental health score of 6, suggesting moderate mental health is associated with the highest vulnerability.

           2.As scores increase beyond 6, risk sharply drops â€” indicating better mental health correlates with reduced risk.

## 3. Academics and Sleep Affected (by Gender)
- Question: How do gender and addiction impact academic performance and sleep?
